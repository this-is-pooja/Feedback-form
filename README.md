#  Feedback form for a restaurant

 
This is a feedback form for restaurant customers. There are two tabs, the first tab will show a form and the second form will show the feedback information which is given by the customer. Then, when I click the submit button, all information will be saved locally with the help of localstorage. And will show a popup message that thanks for your information. If you reload the application, the information is never removed. And this information will show in the second tab with a table format.

## Tech. stack I used

### `react-router-dom`

React Router DOM used to implement dynamic routing. that allows us to display pages and allow users to navigate them. 

### `sweetalert2 and sweetalert2-react-content`

They are used for making the popup message.
